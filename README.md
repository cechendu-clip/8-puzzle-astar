# 8-Puzzle Solver using A* Search (Python)

This program solves the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm with two heuristics:
- Misplaced Tiles (h1)
- Manhattan Distance (h2)

It reports:
- Solution path (step-by-step)
- Nodes generated
- Nodes expanded

## Files
- `main.py` : handles user input and runs the solver
- `astar.py` : contains A* search, heuristics, solvability check, and helper functions

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (recommended)

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:

```bash
python main.py
